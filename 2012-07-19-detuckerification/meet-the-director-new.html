<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">John Rowehl is a doctoral student in the Performance Practice program within Cornell's Department of Music.

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Trained in classical piano from the age of seven, and a competition-winning pianist as a teenager, John first came to Cornell as a graduate student in Philosophy (an affliction from which he has mostly recovered). John's performance focus is on choral conducting, and his dissertation examines the tension between standard conceptions of the performance practice of choral art music and the role of music in creating and sustaining community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">When not in the library or at a choral rehearsal, John teaches in Cornell's vocal coaching program, learns Ghanaian music with the World Drum and Dance Ensemble, and indulges his love of beach volleyball as often as Ithaca's weather permits.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">John earned a B.A. in philosophy at Stanford University, where he also studied voice and served as vocal accompanist.&nbsp;</span>John has been heard as baritone soloist in the Finger Lakes Bach Festival, with Ensemble Sine Nomine, and NYS Baroque. A long-time member of the Cayuga Vocal Ensemble, John served in 1997-1998 as the group's Acting Musical Director.&nbsp;</p>
