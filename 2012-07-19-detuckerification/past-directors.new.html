    <strong>Director:</strong>&nbsp;1889 - 1921

<p>
    <span style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;">The first official director of the Glee Club, Dann is largely responsible for its original success and acclaim. Beginning many of the ensemble's traditions, Dann encouraged frequent tours throughout the United States and brought the Glee Club to England in 1895. He went on to become a noted music educator and was amongst the first people inducted into the Music Educators Hall of Fame. Besides serving as president of MENC, he edited and compiled numerous anthologies and the eight volume&nbsp;<em>Hollis Dann Music Course</em>.</span>

    <strong>Director:</strong>&nbsp;1921-1942
</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">
    Coming from England, Dudley took the leads from Dann and maintained the discipline and musicality of the ensemble. He moved the Glee Club into the popular area of variety shows with novelty acts and a script to fit the musical numbers around. Dudley successfully brought the club through years of financial difficulty and World War I and maintained the title of director emeritus after his term. Passionate about the teaching of voice lessons, his pupils include notables like Marie Powers, Arthur Kent, Dorothy Sarnoff, Marie Maher Walkins, and Bruce Boyce.&nbsp;

        <strong>Director:</strong>&nbsp;1942 - 1945&nbsp;
    </h5>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        As director during World War II, Kuypers tried in vain to keep the men singing. Inevitably, the ensemble dwindled to under twenty members and was forced into a two-year hiatus during Kuyper's tenure.&nbsp;

        </h5>
        <p style="text-align: right;">
            Weaver was given the difficult task of restoring the Glee Club to prominence after the war. In his single year, he successfully increased membership and returned music to Cornell. Unfortunately, he passed away unexpectedly the day after auditioning new members for fall 1946.&nbsp;

                <span style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;">As the only alumnus to serve as director, Tracy was a perfect fit. A member of the Class of 1931, Tracy had already served as assistant director under Eric Dudley. Tracy brought the Glee Club's variety show performances throughout the United States and even to Mexico in 1954, the first international tour since 1895. During Tracy's tenure, the ensemble also entered the world of television, performing on <em>The Kate Smith TV Hour</em> and <em>The Perry Como Show</em>.&nbsp;</span>

        Director of the Glee Club for an astounding thirty-eight years, Sokol brought about dramatic changes in repertoire. Leading ground-breaking tours to the Soviet Union, China, and throughout Southeast Asia, Sokol brought the Glee Club outside of the country on ten different occasions. The Sokol era saw performances of major classical works with notable orchestras and conductors like Eugene Ormandy, Nadia Boulanger, and Karel Husa. Sokol returned as acting Director while Professor Tucker was on sabbatical during the 2002-2003 academic year.&nbsp;

                Tucker successfully filled the shoes of Thomas Sokol, also taking on directing duties for the Chorus and founding the World Music Choir. Taking the Glee Club on its first two tours to South America, Tucker significantly expanded the repertoire of African and world music. He also led the Glee Club on Garrison Keillor's <em>Prairie Home Companion</em> radio program and in multiple concerts with internationally-acclaimed musician Samite Mulondo.&nbsp;
